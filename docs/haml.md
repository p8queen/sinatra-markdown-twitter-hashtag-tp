# What is Haml?

Haml takes your gross, ugly templates and replaces them with veritable Haiku.

Haml is the next step in generating views in your Rails application. Haml is a refreshing take that is meant to free us from the shitty templating languages we have gotten used to.

**Haml is based on one primary principle. Markup should be beautiful.**

However, its not beauty for beauty’s sake. Unspace Interactive and several other professional Rails shops use Haml exclusively for every one of their projects. In fact, it was created for use in highly productive environments. The beauty makes you faster.

Haml is a real solution to a real problem. Stop using the slow, repetitive, and annoying templates that you don’t even know how much you hate yet. Try something new — make templates fun and beautiful again!

**If you sit down and try using Haml, you will learn it within 20 minutes.**

Give yourself 5 minutes to read the Tutorial and then go convert one of your ERB templates to Haml. Feel the power of the Delete key. Simplify. Enjoy. Laugh. 20 minutes later, you will never go back.
